CiviCRM Custom File Diff Tool

This is a simple script for identifying the customizations you have
made to CiviCRM templates and code.  This is useful to run in advance
of upgrades: the resulting file can be used for reapplying your changes
to upgraded versions of the files.

How to Set Up
-------------

The default settings presume you have a Drupal site with the custom
files in

  sites/default/files/civicrm/customtemplates 
  
and
  
  sites/default/files/civicrm/customphp

This folder is presumed to have the same parent folder as the web root,
assumed to be public_html.

You can see examples for WordPress and Joomla!, as well.  Edit the
settings appropriately to your installation.

You will also need to download a new copy of CiviCRM, untar it, and tell
the script where it is.  The comments above the newversion setting show
the appropriate paths for each CMS' version.  This will be the source
of the new template and PHP files.

How to Run
----------

Simply enter from the command line

  ./civi_custom_file_diff
  
from this folder.  Two new patch files will be created showing the
differences in template and PHP files.  Two new directories will be
created.  They will have the original file from the new version of
CiviCRM that corresponds to each customized file from your existing
site.  Any other files in the directories are copied directly from your
existing site.  You can apply your patches to these:

  cd customtemplates-2012-12-03 patch -p7 < template-alldiffs-2012-12-03
  
and likewise for the custom PHP.

Other Uses
----------

Already upgraded but still need to find what changes have been made
as compared to the old version?  Just download a fresh copy of the old
version, untar it somewhere, edit the civicrmcode line to point to it,
and edit the newversion line to point to your new version.

Checking an extension you wrote that overrides templates or other code?
Edit the customtemplates and customphp lines to point to your extension's
templates or code:

  public_html/sites/default/files/civicrm/extensions/yourextension/templates
  
for the templates and

  public_html/sites/default/files/civicrm/extensions/yourextension
  
for the PHP.
