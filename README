CiviCRM Custom File Diff Tool

This is a simple script for identifying the customizations you have made to CiviCRM templates and code.  This is useful to run in advance of upgrades: the resulting file can be used for reapplying your changes to upgraded versions of the files.

How to Set Up
-------------

The default settings presume you have a Drupal site with the custom files in 
   sites/default/files/civicrm/customtemplates and 
   sites/default/files/civicrm/customphp

This folder is presumed to have the same parent folder as the web root, assumed to be public_html.

You can see examples for WordPress and Joomla!, as well.  Edit the settings appropriately to your installation.

How to Run
----------

Simply enter from the command line
   ./civi_custom_file_diff
from this folder.  Two new files will be created showing the differences in template and PHP files

Other Uses
----------

Already upgraded but still need to find what changes have been made as compared to the old version?  Just download a fresh copy of the old version, untar it somewhere, and edit the civicrmcode line to point to it.

Checking an extension you wrote that overrides templates or other code?  Edit the customtemplates and customphp lines to point to your extension's templates or code:
public_html/sites/default/files/civicrm/extensions/yourextension/templates for the templates and
public_html/sites/default/files/civicrm/extensions/yourextension for the PHP.
